YukiGram is an open-source messaging platform that serves as an alternative to Telegram. It originated as a fork of OwlGram, a well-known messaging application that is now inactive.
The decision to fork OwlGram was driven by my genuine appreciation for the project. I was disappointed when the developers officially announced their retirement. In light of this, I took it upon myself to carry on their work and bring the application up to date with the latest version of Telegram.

## Compilation guide
To reproduce the build of YukiGram is only needed ccache (**already installed in "Tools" folder**), on macOs
will be used from Homebrew if installed, otherwise it will be used the one in the "Tools" folder.

1. [**Obtain your own api_id**](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) for your application and put [**here**](https://github.com/ImOnlyFire/YukiGram/blob/master/TMessagesProj/src/main/java/me/onlyfire/yukigram/android/Extra.example) (remember to **rename** Extra.example to Extra.java).
2. Please **do not** use the name Telegram for your app — or make sure your users understand that it is unofficial.
3. Kindly **do not** use our standard logo (white paper plane in a blue circle) as your app's logo.
4. Please study our [**security guidelines**](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines) and take good care of your users' data and privacy.
5. Please remember to publish **your** code too in order to comply with the licences.
